                        <h3>Presentation</h3>
                        <p>This questionnaire forms part of a project launched by the European Deafblind Network (EDbN) in the framework of a Grundtvig Learning Partnership in Deafblindness (GLP-Db). This partnership was established by the Lifelong Learning Programme of the European Commission and officially brings together nine organizations active in the field of deafblindness in Europe. </p>
<p>The partners involved in the project have developed the European Deafblind Indicators. This list of indicators has been specifically adapted to deafblindness from the existing Indicators on Disability Equality in Europe (IDEE), as defined by the Academic Network of European Disability experts (ANED).</p>
<p>The data collected using these indicators should help to define best practices on a European level and to recommend models of care in this field.
In this current phase, this questionnaire based on a selection of these European Deafblind Indicators has been distributed to national deafblind organizations in each of the European States.
More information about the partners and the activities of the project can be found on the website: <a href="www.deafblindindicators.eu">www.deafblindindicators.eu</a>. </p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">1. Please read this page before completing the questionnaire.</li>
   <li class="list-group-item">2. Please note that all the information in the form should be referenced to your geographic reporting.</li>
   <li class="list-group-item">3. Please complete the questionnaire in English.</li>
   <li class="list-group-item">4. The questionnaire is a snapshot and should reflect the most recent and most accurate information available to your organization.
</li>
   <li class="list-group-item">5. Please note that some questions may require some consultation with other agencies, like your national administrations or any existing statistics in your country. In some questions you are asked to make clear if the source of your answer recognised statistical information from a reliable source, whether it is an estimate or whether the figure is unknown in your country. For example, you may not have a survey of deafblind people in your country, but you may have a rough idea based on statistical information collated over the years. In this case, you should record an estimated figure.
</li>
   <li class="list-group-item">6. The project assumes that in many countries there may be little information available. Please leave questions unanswered where you do not have the relevant information. Please answer only what you know. 
</li>
   <li class="list-group-item">7. The project assumes that in many countries there may be little information available. Please leave questions unanswered where you do not have the relevant information. Please answer only what you know. 
</li>
   <li class="list-group-item">8. The language and reporting elements used in this questionnaire are consistent with those standards generally accepted in deafblind publications.
</li>
   <li class="list-group-item">9. Should you require any further information regarding the completion of the questionnaire, please e-mail rlopez@edbn.org (copy to jfreixes@edbn.org). 
</li>
   <li class="list-group-item">10. Any other information which you feel may be relevant can also be included on the separate sheet at the end of the questionnaire.

                        <h3>Definition of Deafblindness</h3>
                        <p>Although each State has its own criteria, the Nordic definition of deafblindness is widely accepted as the common working standard definition: “Deafblindness is a distinct disability. It is a combined vision and hearing disability. It limits activities of a person and restricts full participation in society to such a degree that society is required to facilitate specific services, environmental alterations and/or technology (Nordisk Lederforum, 2007).<br/>
                        <ul>
  <li>Congenital deafblindness. Born deaf and blind or become deaf and blind early in life before the development of language (pre-lingual deafblindness).</li>
  <li>Acquired deafblindness. Become deaf and blind after the development of language (post-lingual deafblindness).</li>
  <li>Older people1 deafblindness. Acquired deafblindness which appears in old-age. This is an emergent and little known situation”.</li>
</ul>
